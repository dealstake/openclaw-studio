# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve OpenClaw Studio. Please use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.

## Before you start
- Install OpenClaw and confirm the gateway runs locally.
- This repo is UI-only and reads config from `~/.openclaw` with legacy fallback to `~/.moltbot` or `~/.clawdbot`.
- It does not run or build the gateway from source.

## Local setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grp06/openclaw-studio.git
cd openclaw-studio
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

## Testing
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run e2e` (requires `npx playwright install`)

## Pull requests
- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Include the tests you ran.
- Link to the relevant issue.
- If you changed gateway behavior, call it out explicitly.

## Reporting issues
When filing an issue, please include:
- Reproduction steps
